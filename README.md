# Simple-Object-Detection-Using-HAAR-Cascade-Classifers
This project consists of two mini projects. Both the mini projects uses HAAR Cascade Classifiers for specific object detection like face, eye, pedestrians and cars.<br/>
A Haar Cascade is basically a classifier which is used to detect the object for which it has been trained for, from the source. The Haar Cascade is trained by superimposing the positive image over a set of negative images.<br/><br/>
For example- If we are training HAAR cascade for classifying faces then positive images would be the images with human faces in it and negative images would be images without human faces with it.<br/><br/>
(**Note:** Some comment lines are included for better understanding of the code)

## Mini Project 1
This mini project consists of three modules.
- The first module detects human faces from an image fed to it.
- The second module detects eyes from human face.
- The third module is a real time face and eye detection using the system's webcam

## Mini Project 2
This mini project consists of two modules.
- The first module identifies pedestrains walking in the video
- The second module identifies cars.
